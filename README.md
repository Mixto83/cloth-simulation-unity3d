# Cloth simulation for Unity3D
Simulation of cloth physics for unity3d using a spring-mass model. Exercise proposed by Miguel √Ångel Otaduy.

## Points this simulation covers

1- Spring-Mass physics model applied to a mesh's vertices and edges.

2- Fixer class that fixes some vertices to a place to be able to see the effect.

3- Flexion springs added on top of the traction ones formed with the edges from the mesh.

4- Damping force.

5- Wind force.

6- Collisions (TODO)
